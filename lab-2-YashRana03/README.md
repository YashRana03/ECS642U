# Lab 2 COMPLETE CODE/ CHECKED IN VIVA BY LAB DEMONSTRATOR

The code:

  * Changes the direction of the current Led travel when B1 is pressed
  * Toggles the state of all the Leds when B5 is pressed

B1 is polled. Button B5 is handled by an interrupt (possible because it has hardware debounce).
